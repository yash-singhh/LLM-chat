Chat with Any LLM - Interactive Notebook
Description
This notebook provides an interactive environment to chat with various Large Language Models (LLMs). It allows users to explore LLM capabilities for tasks such as text generation, summarization, and question answering. The implementation is flexible, enabling seamless integration with popular LLM APIs like OpenAI's GPT, Meta's Llama, and others.

Working
Connects to specified LLM APIs through preconfigured endpoints.
Allows user input to generate responses dynamically from the selected LLM.
Includes customizable parameters for temperature, max tokens, and other model settings.
Displays outputs in a clear and user-friendly format for experimentation and evaluation.
How to Implement
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
Navigate to the directory:

bash
Copy code
cd Chat_with_any_LLM
Install Dependencies:
Ensure Python 3.x is installed, then run:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set Up API Keys:
Add your LLM API credentials (e.g., OpenAI API key) in the notebook or as environment variables:

python
Copy code
api_key = "your-api-key-here"
Run the Notebook:
Launch Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook L5_Chat_with_any_LLM.ipynb
Open the notebook in your browser and follow the steps to start chatting with your selected LLM.

Customizations:
Modify parameters such as model selection, temperature, or max token limits directly in the notebook to fit your use case.

Features
Support for multiple LLMs (OpenAI GPT, Meta Llama, etc.).
Easy-to-use interface for input and output interaction.
Configurable model parameters for experimentation.
